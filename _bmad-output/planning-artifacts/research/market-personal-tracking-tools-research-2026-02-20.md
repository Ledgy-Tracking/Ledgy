### Customer Interaction Patterns

_Research and Discovery:_ Users discover tools through Reddit communities, YouTube reviews, and "awesome" lists (awesome-selfhosted). Word-of-mouth in developer and PKM communities is critical.

_Evaluation Process:_ Users evaluate based on: (1) data ownership model, (2) offline capability, (3) extensibility/plugins, (4) learning curve, (5) community size. Free/open-source is a major trust signal.

_Post-Adoption Behavior:_ Power users become evangelists. Plugin/template creators drive ecosystem growth. Communities form around shared templates and workflows.

_Retention Drivers:_ Data lock-in (positive — users invest heavily in their systems). Community and plugin ecosystem. Regular updates and responsive maintainers.

### Open-Source Self-Hosted Landscape (Direct Competitive Context)

Key open-source alternatives users consider:
- **AFFiNE** — Block-based, local-first, document-whiteboard fusion
- **AppFlowy** — Notion-like, privacy-first, local-first architecture
- **Logseq** — Knowledge management, Markdown/Org-mode, "second brain"
- **Anytype** — Local-first, peer-to-peer, source-available
- **SiYuan** — Local-first, block-based, strong API

None of these offer Ledgy's combination of: **flexible ledger schema + visual scripting engine + unified plugin system + cross-project relations + AI-powered entry**. This is a genuine gap in the market.

## Customer Pain Points and Needs

### Customer Challenges and Frustrations

**The "Goldilocks Dilemma" dominates user sentiment.** Users consistently report that tools are either too feature-rich and overwhelming (Notion, Coda) or too simplistic to provide real organizational value (basic habit trackers, simple to-do apps). Finding the right balance is the #1 frustration.

_Primary Frustrations:_
- **Complexity overload**: Users spend more time managing the tool than doing actual work. Notion's setup time is frequently cited as a barrier.
- **Fragmentation**: 60% of users adopt a second app because their primary tool has missing features. 91% say they would consolidate to one app if it met all their needs.
- **Tedious data entry**: Manual input is overwhelming. Users want AI-powered, friction-free capture (photos, voice, auto-import).
- **"Productivity theater"**: Progress dashboards and streak reminders can become psychologically punishing — apps feel accusatory when users fall behind.

_Usage Barriers:_ Obsidian is "ugly out of the box" and requires significant plugin setup. Notion lags with large databases. Both require significant investment before delivering value.

_Sources: [reddit.com](https://reddit.com), [androidauthority.com](https://androidauthority.com), [ffnews.com](https://ffnews.com)_

### Unmet Customer Needs

_Critical Unmet Needs:_
1. **One platform for everything** — track fitness, finances, habits, projects, and custom data in one place without juggling 3–5 apps
2. **AI-powered data entry** — image-to-ledger, voice-to-entry, auto-categorization
3. **Flexible schema without code** — user-defined fields without needing to be a developer
4. **Visual automation** — connect data sources and triggers without writing scripts
5. **True offline-first with reliable sync** — work without internet, sync when convenient

_Solution Gaps Ledgy Can Fill:_
- No major tool combines flexible ledger schema + visual scripting + plugin system
- Obsidian users want better database/table features (like Notion's)
- Notion users want better offline, privacy, and performance
- Both communities want visual automation without code

### Barriers to Adoption

| Barrier Type | Details | Ledgy's Answer |
|---|---|---|
| **Price** | Subscription fatigue — users pay for 5+ tools. "Free" apps monetize data. | Open source, free-tier infrastructure (GCE/Firebase) |
| **Technical** | Steep learning curves (Obsidian plugins), complex setup, Markdown intimidation | Visual-first approach, project templates, gradual complexity |
| **Trust** | Cloud-only tools raise data privacy anxiety. "Free" apps sell user data. | Local-first PouchDB, open source, self-hostable, no data monetization |
| **Convenience** | Poor mobile experience, bad offline support, slow performance with large datasets | Tauri mobile builds, offline-first architecture, per-project DB isolation |

### Customer Satisfaction Gaps

_Expectation Gaps:_
- Users expect AI to truly reduce work, but current AI features often create *more* work (reviewing AI outputs, fixing errors = "workslop")
- Notion's AI feels bolted-on; Obsidian's AI is plugin-only and fragmented
- Users want AI that understands their data schema and context, not generic chatbots

_Quality Gaps:_
- Mobile experiences are consistently rated as inferior to desktop across all major tools
- Sync reliability is a persistent pain point (Obsidian Sync costs $8/mo, Notion requires internet)
- Performance degrades as users' data grows — exactly when the tool becomes most valuable

_Value Perception Gaps:_
- Open-source tools feel "free but unpolished"
- Premium tools feel "polished but extractive"
- Gap: **polished AND open AND free** — this is where Ledgy can position itself

### Retention Crisis: Why Users Abandon

**Productivity apps have a brutal retention curve: only ~4.1% of users remain active after 30 days.**

| Churn Reason | Frequency | Ledgy Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| App adds complexity instead of reducing it | Very High | Progressive disclosure — start simple, unlock complexity |
| Lost motivation / tracking feels tedious | High | AI-powered entry, visual automation, reduce manual input |
| Tool doesn't fit personal workflow | High | Flexible schema, user-defined fields, custom nodes |
| Privacy/data concerns | Medium | Local-first, open source, no data monetization |
| Better alternative found | Medium | Unique value prop (ledger+scripting+plugins) |
| Cost/subscription fatigue | Medium | Free, self-hostable, free-tier cloud |

_Critical Insight:_ The shift in 2025 is from "features" to "fewer features, faster use." Users want a **system of record** — one tool that's the single source of truth, not an everything-app that does everything poorly.

## Strategic Recommendations for Ledgy

### 1. Position as "The Open Platform for Personal Data"

Don't compete with Notion on "all-in-one workspace." Instead, own the positioning of:
> **"Your data, your schema, your rules — the open-source platform that tracks anything, powered by AI."**

This captures: data ownership + flexibility + AI + open source — all in one sentence.

### 2. Target the "Privacy-First Builder" Segment First

| Priority | Segment | Why First |
|---|---|---|
| 🥇 Primary | Privacy-First Builders | Most aligned values, most forgiving of early-stage UX, will become evangelists |
| 🥈 Secondary | Quantified Self | Strong fit after templates + AI entry are polished |
| 🥉 Tertiary | All-in-One Organizers | Only target after UX is comparable to Notion |

### 3. Solve the "Goldilocks Problem" with Progressive Complexity

```
Level 1: Pick a template → start tracking → zero config
Level 2: Customize fields → add relations → adjust views
Level 3: Visual scripting → custom nodes → plugin system
```

This directly addresses the #1 market pain point: tools are either too simple or too complex.

### 4. Lead with AI-Powered Entry

The clearest, most compelling demo for Ledgy:
- 📸 Take a photo of a receipt → AI extracts data → creates ledger entry
- 🎙️ Voice note → AI parses → creates structured entry
- This solves the #2 market pain point: manual data entry friction

### 5. Distribution Strategy

| Channel | Action | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| **GitHub** | Open source, clear README, good documentation | Critical |
| **Reddit** | r/selfhosted, r/ObsidianMD, r/productivity posts | Critical |
| **awesome-selfhosted** | Get listed on curated open-source lists | High |
| **YouTube** | Partner with PKM/productivity creators for reviews | High |
| **Hacker News** | "Show HN" launch post | Medium |

### 6. Monetization (Future)

Stay free and open source for core. Potential revenue:
- **Hosted CouchDB sync** — managed sync service for non-technical users ($3–5/mo)
- **Premium project templates** — curated templates for specific use cases
- **Enterprise/team features** — if demand emerges (not a priority)
